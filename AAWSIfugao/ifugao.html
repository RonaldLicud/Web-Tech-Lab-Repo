<p> There are many varieties of the wedding dances of the Ifugaos. But one thing in common to them is that their dances reflect their values, longing, courtesy, and spirituality. 
Example of this is raising their, their palms facing  upwards and waving it up and down means rejecting and warding off evil spirits. The womenâ€™s soft and meek movements, while staring at the men, 
who are showing humility and respect to their tribesmate. Thrusting their arms and palms open,  pointing up to the sky is one  on how they express their thankfulness to God, 
while stomping on the ground with some bodily movements symbolize oneness with the earth and nature. </p>
